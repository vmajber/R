This year I will make it a reality. I've drawn up course descriptions, found a space to rent, ensured that I can get liability insurance. There has already been a buzz among my students and their parents about how much fun this camp will be.<br/><br/>My space rental at a local church needs to paid 50% now and 50% in July. I am asking for this loan to pay the space rental fees and some initial supplies and advertising fees. <br/><br/>There are three separate courses the children can enroll in, based on their age and experience. In order to break even, I need to recruit a total of 20 children for the two camps for younger kids and 6 children for the camp for older kids. I have a studio of 25 students I teach weekly, plus I have a waiting list. I am a popular teacher -- last year I had only 2 students discontinue lessons. The previous year I had 0 students discontinue lessons. I receive calls and emails monthly asking for new students. Because of this, I don't feel that with the proper advertising that I'll have any trouble filling my camp spaces.<br/><br/>I've priced the camps at a reasonable rate for the area I live in, and I've taken into account expenses including insurance, supplies, fees to hire an assistant teacher, my own salary, and taxes. <br/><br/>In addition to my full-time job teaching piano, I work part-time as a computer programmer for a company that works on government contracts.<br/>",small_business,Piano Camp Funding,220xx,VA,20.38,0.0729

I just got ready to pay my bills and am in better shape that I thought.  If I could just get a loan of $8000, that will cover everything!

Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 12/20/10 > There was something wrong with my computer last night and I want to be able to respond to the question.  I accumulated much of this debt when I was travelling between WA and AK when my mother was sick and still had many expenses for my daughter's treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder.  I am currently a Clinical Therapist for an adult unit at a psychitric hosptial.  Prior to that I worked at Regence Blue Shield for almost five years as a Medical Managment Coordinator where I managed the mental health and chemical dependency benefits for Federal Employees.  I have also been an ER social worker and a renal social worker.  I got my first job when i was 15 years old and have always worked to support myself and take care of my family.  The public record is a bankruptcy in 2001.  When my husband lost his job in 2001 in the tech fall out, our financial lives fell down around us.  Even though I was working, it was not enough.  We worked hard to rebuild our credit.  I am financially responsibile for our two children, and do receive child support and mainteance at $1800 per month.  I gave a list of my major expenses.  I am not sure why the other part of the response got cut off.  Please consider funding my loan.  It would be such a blessing to my little family.

I have a very secure job that I've been working at for four years.  My position isn't in jeopardy, even in the current economy.    Between my wife and I, we bring home roughly 5000 a month.
