This year I will make it a reality. I've drawn up course descriptions, found a space to rent, ensured that I can get liability insurance. There has already been a buzz among my students and their parents about how much fun this camp will be.<br/><br/>My space rental at a local church needs to paid 50% now and 50% in July. I am asking for this loan to pay the space rental fees and some initial supplies and advertising fees. <br/><br/>There are three separate courses the children can enroll in, based on their age and experience. In order to break even, I need to recruit a total of 20 children for the two camps for younger kids and 6 children for the camp for older kids. I have a studio of 25 students I teach weekly, plus I have a waiting list. I am a popular teacher -- last year I had only 2 students discontinue lessons. The previous year I had 0 students discontinue lessons. I receive calls and emails monthly asking for new students. Because of this, I don't feel that with the proper advertising that I'll have any trouble filling my camp spaces.<br/><br/>I've priced the camps at a reasonable rate for the area I live in, and I've taken into account expenses including insurance, supplies, fees to hire an assistant teacher, my own salary, and taxes. <br/><br/>In addition to my full-time job teaching piano, I work part-time as a computer programmer for a company that works on government contracts.<br/>",11,Piano Camp Funding,220xx,44,20.38,0.0729

My car is paid off and I want to get back to just one debt--my home mortgage.  I like to use credit cards and pay them off every month.

I have been planning for my wedding but had family health emergencies-my soon to be mother in law had to undergo an emergency back surgery and we helped foot this bill. We ended up using the savings we had put aside for the wedding for this. Now I am currently in immediate need to finance to pay for various deposits needed for my wedding. I am very good at paying my bill on time and I don't like to carry debts, so when I do, I try my best to pay off as fast as possible. I appreciate all your help with this.

I have worked hard to manage my money and budget since my husband moved out two years ago.  I just want a clean start and to make one payment.  Our divorce is going to be going to be final this month. If you look at my credit report, you will see that I have never missed a payment on any of my cards.  My Honda got paid off in September.  I take a lot of pride in paying my bills.  Please consider helping me get a fresh start.  I attempted going to a local loan agency and they quoted a ridiculous (24.9%) rate!  I am good for this loan and can gurantee it will be paid on time, every month!  Thank you for your time and consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 12/13/10 > I wanted to add an update.  I just got ready to pay my bills and am in better shape that I thought.  If I could just get a loan of $8000, that will cover everything!  It turns out not charging and paying more than the minimum is really making a difference!  Please consider helping me with my loan. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 12/20/10 > There was something wrong with my computer last night and I want to be able to respond to the question.  I accumulated much of this debt when I was travelling between WA and AK when my mother was sick and still had many expenses for my daughter's treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder.  I am currently a Clinical Therapist for an adult unit at a psychitric hosptial.  Prior to that I worked at Regence Blue Shield for almost five years as a Medical Managment Coordinator where I managed the mental health and chemical dependency benefits for Federal Employees.  I have also been an ER social worker and a renal social worker.  I got my first job when i was 15 years old and have always worked to support myself and take care of my family.  The public record is a bankruptcy in 2001.  When my husband lost his job in 2001 in the tech fall out, our financial lives fell down around us.  Even though I was working, it was not enough.  We worked hard to rebuild our credit.  I am financially responsibile for our two children, and do receive child support and mainteance at $1800 per month.  I gave a list of my major expenses.  I am not sure why the other part of the response got cut off.  Please consider funding my loan.  It would be such a blessing to my little family.
